:mod:`PYTOOLS.animation` --- Animation utilities
================================================

This module provides basic utilities to play :mod:`matplotlib` animations where each frame belongs to a regular 1D grid over an interval of simulation times, split into a sequence of contiguous intervals called tracks. The actual content of a frame is arbitrary. Frames are normally enumerated by walking through the grid, but jumps within the grid are allowed and can be controlled from a GUI.
